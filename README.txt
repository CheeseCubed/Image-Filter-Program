Additional Notes:
================

	There are some personal notes/ideas written in the code itself, you may ignore them as they don't affect usage.
	
	Potential (later) additions:
		* allow user to select type & amount of filters that they'd like to apply
		* add more filter options
		* implement a GUI for the user, instead of command-line entry.
